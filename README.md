### 5. **Collaboration and Support**

The FOSS Club encourages collaboration, mentorship, and knowledge sharing. Be supportive of others’ learning journeys, and be patient with those who may have less experience. In our community:
- Constructive feedback should be offered when requested, and should be presented in a clear, helpful manner.
- If disagreements arise, they should be handled respectfully and with a focus on resolving the issue rather than attacking the individual.

It is everyone’s responsibility to ensure that the environment is positive and that everyone has the opportunity to learn, contribute, and grow.
